- 2 cups (1 pint) fresh blueberries 
- 1/4 cup granulated sugar
- 2 tsp cornstarch
- 1 1/2 tbs lemon juice 

Instructions:
1. First, prepare your blueberry filling. in a small bowl, gently toss together the fresh blueberries, sugar, lemon juice and cornstarch. Set aside. 
2. preheat your oven to 375 deg F, and grease your baking pan (I used an 8x8 inch baking pan).
3. In your electric mixer bowl, combine the flour, sugar, baking powder, butter and egg, and mix until the dough is moist but very crumbly. 
4. Divide the dough in half, and press one half into your prepared pan so you have an even layer of "crust".
5. Next, pour the blueberry filling mixture over the dough pressed into the pan. 
6. Take the rest of the crumbly dough and sprinkle it over the blueberries. 
7. Bake for 35 - 45 minutes, or until the juices are bubbling and the dough has browned a little bit (watch the bars carefully towards the end of the baking time so they don't brown too much and don't dry out). 
8. Let cool completely before cutting and eating!
